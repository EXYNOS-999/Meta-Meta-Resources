Unfortunately there aren't too many existing compilations of grant, fellowship, and job application submissions, but there are some! Hopefully they can help provide a template for your own future application.

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [NDSEG compilation of essays](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ut7fWlFrpmuyZOaqsca_-zxcPE2KSub-) | A small list of essays for the NDSEG competition only from the 2019-2020 cycle so far; however, perhaps the largest public collection of such essays |
| [NSF compilation of essays and reviews](https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship#h.p_ID_272) | Alex Lang build this popular spreadsheet that links to NSF GRFP essays and reviews from winners and non-winners alike |
| [Open Grants](https://www.ogrants.org/) | A list of submitted applications across grants, though there seems to be a tilt toward faculty members |
| [Successful Job Applications and Grants](https://github.com/RILAB/statements) | The job and grants applications in this repository don't touch upon cognitive neuroscience, but they are nonetheless open which in of themselves makes them useful guides, regardless of their topic; and of course, more resources could always be added |
