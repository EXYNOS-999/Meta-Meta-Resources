description: Centralizing comprehensive resources in cognitive neuroscience
---

This web book centralizes comprehensive resource collections in cognitive neuroscience, spanning all parts of the research cycle. It also rounds out these collections by comprising of new collections, on pages marked with an asterisk, for topics where no existing open-source compilation previously exists. These two types of compilations—existing and new—are themselves the meta resources that together render this web book a meta resource of meta resources.
