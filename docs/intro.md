A single resource, and starting point, to go off of for almost everything (and if not, you can change that!) in cognitive neuroscience and, more broadly, psychology and neuroscience research.


## Why
This resource is an attempt to aggregate as many of the resources out there that help people do excellent cognitive neuroscience and related fields work. It was made as a way of organizing so many bookmarks that get saved from places like Twitter, and perhaps just as importantly, of helping keep them up to date.



## How

All of the resources shared here are either themselves lists (editable in as many cases as could be found), or together form a list that is each page in this web book. This web book can thus be thought of as having a couple layers. More often than not, the links that follow are lists, and therefore if a resource can be thought of as the lowest level on a hierarchy of abstraction, the links that list these resources are one level up. This web book, which compiles a bunch of these links that are one level up, is therefore two levels up in a way. For some topics, however, there exists no list, or a one-level-up link, summarizing those resources. In those cases, the pages will be marked by an asterisk at the end of their name and indicate, in order to showcase the contribution of this web book,  that they are the one-level-up resource.

For example, there is no actively maintained and editable list of online experiment communities and builders. So the page XYZ is itself the aggregate list of existing resources for that topic. The same is true for experiment stimuli not having an existing, actively maintained and editable list anywhere else. In contrast, in the ABC page, you can see that several groups already put together lists of all the journals in the discipline, or throughout the DEF section, how the new website GHI has been compiling digital tools for academia. The ultimate goals are to keep this resource relevant, up-to-date, and of course helpful more broadly.
