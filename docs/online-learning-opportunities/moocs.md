Most of the following resources cover a wide array of topics and are of course free!

| Resource | Description|
|----------|------------|
| [MOOC List](https://www.mooc-list.com/multiple-criteria) | Aggregates the search indexes across the big-name MOOC websites like Coursera, EdX, etc. so that you don't have to search each of those websites separately |
| [Class Central](https://www.classcentral.com) |  Quite similar to MOOC List |
| [A List of Web Dev Courses](https://github.com/lndgalante/courses-list) | This list is limited to web development courses, but its strength is that it includes websites that are small but great rather than the aggregators that search just among large MOOC websites |
| [List of University Courses for Learning Computer Science](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses) | An extensive list of computer science courses, including sometimes just a syllabus when there are no videos for a class |
| [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) | It turns out YouTube is home to many recordings of online classes, and might well be the best starting point for online class videos |
| [Open Learning Initiative](https://oli.cmu.edu/independent-learner-courses) | A supplementary MOOC website that isn't included in MOOC List or Class Central |
| [Open Yale Courses](https://oyc.yale.edu) | Another supplementary MOOC website that isn't included in MOOC List or Class Central
