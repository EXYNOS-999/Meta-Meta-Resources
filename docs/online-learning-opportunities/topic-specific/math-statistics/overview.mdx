The following is an up-to-date version of [Awesome Math](https://github.com/rossant/awesome-math). It is a wonderful overview of free online math resources, including loads of booksâ€”in fact it probably has a better list of math textbooks than the Free Ebook Foundation that I link to in [Online Learning Overview](/online-learning-opportunities/overview). See that page, though, for other Math resources and check out the [MOOCs page](/online-learning-opportunities/moocs) for free online classes
