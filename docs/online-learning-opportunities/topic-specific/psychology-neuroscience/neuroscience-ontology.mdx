It can be hard learning and keeping up with terminology in neuroscience. The resources listed below, extracted with permission from an up-to-date document by [OpenLists](https://github.com/openlists/NeuroOntologies), are designed to help. For example, search "visual cortex" on Knowledge Space and you'll find a paragraph-long definition of it, as well ones for related terms like "primary visual cortex," "visual perception," and "visual agnosia." If you visit BrainInfo you can visualize brain structures in an interactive map.
