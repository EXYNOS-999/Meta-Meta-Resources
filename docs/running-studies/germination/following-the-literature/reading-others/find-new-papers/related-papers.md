| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Citation Gecko](https://citationgecko.com) | Given a set of 'seed papers,' you can visualize the most commonly-cited papers, either in an interactive flow chart/timeline or an interactive web |
| [Related References](http://relatedreferences.appspot.com) | Similarly to Citation Gecko, takes a list of papers and finds papers that are also quite similar, except it is not interactive |
| [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com) | Also a similar idea to Citation Gecko, but newer and has additional features |
| [CoCites](http://www.cocites.com) | Also a similar idea to Related References, but also newer and has additional features |
| [scite](https://scite.ai) | Takes a paper's in-text citation and pulls up the lines in that cited paper that are being referenced, says whether those lines provide supportive or disconfirmatory evidence |
