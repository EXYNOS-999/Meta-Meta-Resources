title: Sections that could Particularly Use Additions
sidebar_label: Areas Most Lacking Currently
---

There are quite a few topics that this meta meta resource has not covered in-depth or even at all. Any resource and meta resource recommendations for the following topics would be particularly appreciated:

* Organizations supporting underrepresented groups in STEM. Additions can go under the [eponymous page](/networks/organizations/for-underrepresented-groups).

* Overviews of different methods in cognitive neuroscience and how to implement them. For example, perhaps a breakdown of all the different imaging or EEG databases or the different softwares. [neuroimaging tutorials and resources](https://learn-neuroimaging.github.io/tutorials-and-resources/analysis_software_MRI) is an incredible start, but I have to imagine there are other resources that exist that could complement it. Additions can go under __.

* Free software for running experiments. I have already included a list of [GUI experiment builders for online studies], but it would be quite useful including in-the-lab software, too, and code-based libraries tailored for online behavioral experiment, like [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org). Additions can go under __.

* Resources for learning free programming languages that are not currently in the Free Programming / Markup Stylesheets / etc Languages subsection, like Ruby, PHP, or Julia.

* Experimental stimuli and online experiments. These areas aren't particularly lacking in number, but given how many experiments go on it's easy wonder just how big these two databases could grow.
