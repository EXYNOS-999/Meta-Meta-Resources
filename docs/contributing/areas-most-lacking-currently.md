title: Sections that could Particularly Use Additions
sidebar_label: Areas Most Lacking Currently
---

There are quite a few topics that this meta meta resource has not covered in-depth or even at all. Any resource and meta resource recommendations for the following topics would be particularly appreciated:

* Organizations supporting underrepresented groups in STEM. Additions can go under the [eponymous page](/networks/organizations/for-underrepresented-groups).

* Lists of psychology and neuroscience conferences. Additions can go under the [eponymous page](/opportunities/conferences)

* Resources for learning free programming languages that are not currently in the Free Programming / Markup Stylesheets / etc Languages subsection, like Ruby, PHP, or Julia.

* Experimental stimuli and online experiments. These areas aren't particularly lacking in number, but given how many experiments go on it's easy wonder just how big these two databases could grow.

* Databases of research grants. The Opportunities section covers funding already but is tilted toward early-career opportunities. It would be great to include a free, comprehensive source for finding large grants.

* Tools for performing meta-analyses.

* Currently this web-book is disproportionately U.S.-centric. It would be quite helpful to more include resources from other parts of the world and in other languages, too.
