There are obviously countless resources that already exist even just for a field like cognitive neuroscience. So this website necessarily has to filter for just the most useful resources, so to speak. If adding a resource, keep in mind the following:

* Resources should be pretty unique. For example, there are swaths of services for creating online surveys, and they tend to be similar enough that a list of these survey companies would be both difficult to encapsulate and perhaps not particularly helpful. If you're up for adding such a list, do so! I just identified that as a lower priority. Moreover, I left out some resources for online learning like [Merlot](https://www.merlot.org) since it is already included within the [The Mason OER Metafinder](https://oer.deepwebaccess.com). However, in the case of [Example Application Submissions](/opportunities/example-application-submissions), some of the resources' scopes may overlap (e.g. NSF GRFP, or all types of grants), but so long as there are unique grant submissions under each resource, each resource adds unique value and should be included.

* Resources should be specific. For example, a blog post or tweet about applying to graduate school is likely to only scratch the surface, given the complexity of the process. Short of an exhaustive step-by-step guide, I'd instead recommend adding something narrower but more exhaustive, like Lisa Briand's [list of waiver fees for neuroscience Ph.D. programs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10R0epmS9wthYqchUg_DhQN4NAkNxAkyuVA9NgZG2sWA/edit#gid=0).

* Resources that encompass other resources (meta resources) should be open-source whenever possible. For example, I forewent listing [Words in the World](http://wordsintheworld.ca/research/resources-by-language) for the [list of Linguistics Stimuli](/running-studies/execution/stimuli/experiment-stimuli/linguistics), even though it is more comprehensive than the one I included, because unlike [The Language Goldmine](http://languagegoldmine.com) it is not held on an editable website. Had Words in the World been so much (arbitrarily-defined) better then I would have listed it instead, but I felt that all else was close enough to equal that open-source became decisive. Somewhere in between open and closed source is if a website says recommendations can be emailed, or better yet, if there is a submission form, as is the case for [ReimagineReview](https://reimaginereview.asapbio.org).

* Resources that encompass other resources (meta resources) should be regularly maintained. For example, I considered building off of Jordan Suchow's [awesome-crowds repository](https://github.com/suchow/awesome-crowds) rather than starting the [Online Platforms and Communities](/running-studies/execution/online-platforms-communities) page from scratch. However, his list has not been updated in a few years, and it was broad enough beyond online psychology studies that it seemed there was more to gain than lose by starting a narrower page.
