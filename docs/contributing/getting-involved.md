You are wholly encouraged to contribute links/resources that you've found helpful, perhaps that you've bookmarked over the years. If the resource would fall under a topic that is already aggregated on some other website that is linked here, you should add that resource directly to that website. That might entail adding a new row on a Google doc or submitting a pull request to another repository. Conversely, if you have either a one-level-up link or a resource that falls under an asterisk page, where there is no existing one-level-up link, you can email us or submit a pull request directly to this repository. See below for more details. And don't be afraid that your link might not be relevant or that we might've already listed! We don't mind sifting through your resources and determining what fits and what might not. However, it would help if you stayed within the guidelines detailed on the Documentation page.
