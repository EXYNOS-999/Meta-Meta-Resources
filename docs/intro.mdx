description: Centralizing comprehensive resources in cognitive neuroscience
---

Welcome! The aim of this website is to centralize resources for cognitive neuroscience research. To do so, it builds off existing resources, and the contents on each page coalesce to form a sort of meta-resource for that domain. Sometimes, such a meta resource already exists, in which the website simply embeds it. The web book is composed of well-maintained, open-source, and freely-accessible resources in practically all its domains, except for example for a list of online experiment recruitment platforms which by their nature cost money. Together, all the web pages in turn coalesce to form a meta resource of meta resources for cognitive neuroscience.

If you have resources to share, please see page the [Getting Involved](contributing/getting-involved).
